/****************************************************************
 Scheduler
 ----------------------------------------------------------------
 The scheduler consists of the pcb, queue and priority_queue data
 structures. It serves to consolidate all the includes so that the
 api functions only need to include the scheduler. IT MIGHT BECOME
 A STRUCT WITH A GLOBAL INSTANCE THAT HAS BOTH SCHEDULING QUEUES.
